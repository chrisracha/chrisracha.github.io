            </div>

                <p><strong>4.</strong> If a student is diagnosed to have a communicable disease at any time during the school year, the following procedures should be followed to protect his/her co-students: </p>
                <p>a. Physical examination by a physician.</p>
                <p>b. Laboratory work-out as ordered by the attending physician.</p>
                <p>c. Submit medical findings to the school nurse for follow-up.</p>
                <p>d. If the student is a resident of one of the University’s dormitories, he or she may be quarantined during the communicable stage to prevent the spread of the disease. </p>
                <p>e. If the student is a non-resident, he or she may be asked to be excused from his/her classes during the period of communicability to protect his/her classmates and other students from contracting the disease.</p> 
                <p><strong>5.</strong> Students for medical referrals: </p>
                <p>a. The nurse on duty may accompany the sick student and refer him/ her directly to the retainer hospital or if this is not possible, the nurse may issue an official referral note to the student. The student will present then this to the retainer hospital for easy and fast accommodation and rendering of services. </p>
                <p>b. The expenses incurred during the hospitalization of the student must be borne by the student. </p>
                <p>c. Confidentiality of the Patient’s record — all patients’ records will be treated as confidential. No information will be divulged regarding a student’s condition or treatment without the concerned student’s consent.</p> 
                <p><strong>6.</strong> The nurse on duty will attend daily (from Monday to Sunday) to the minor health problems of the students, faculty, and staff. </p>
                <p>a. The nurse on duty will dispense medicines that do not require a physician’s prescription. </p>
                <p>b. The nurse on duty will provide the initial dose of the over-the counter-medicine. Succeeding doses will be provided by the patient.</p>
