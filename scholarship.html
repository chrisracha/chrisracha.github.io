            <h3>SCHOLARSHIPS AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SECTION</h3>  
            <hr class="hrMain">
        <div class="box">
        <p> <strong>The Scholarships and Financial Assistance Section </strong> provides opportunities for students to meet the costs of education through scholarships and other forms of financial assistance. Under the policies and guidelines approved by the UP Board of Regents, the section administers programs like student loans, student assistantships, private scholarships, and the UP Socialized Tuition System or STS.</p>
    </div>        
        <h2>GRANT OF FREE TUITION & OTHER SCHOOL FEES (RA 10931)</h2> 
        <div class="box">
            <p style="text-align:center"> <strong> AN ACT PROMOTING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO QUALITY TERTIARY EDUCATION BY PROVIDING FOR FREE TUITION AND OTHER SCHOOL FEES IN STATE UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES </strong> </p> 
            <p>• All Filipino students who are either currently enrolled at the time of the effectivity of the Act, or shall enroll at any time thereafter, and courses leading to a bachelor’s degree in any SUC and LUC shall be exempt from paying tuition and other school fees for units enrolled in.</p> 
            <p>• Students will be eligible to receive these benefits provided they qualify under the admission and retention requirements of the SUC.</p>
    </div>
        <h2>EXEMPTION TO FREE HIGHER EDUCATION</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <p> <strong>The following are not eligible to avail of free higher education: </strong> </p> 
            <p> <strong>1.</strong> Students who have already obtained a bachelor’s degree or comparable undergraduate degree from any public or private HEI; </p>
            <p> <strong>2.</strong> Students who fail to comply with the admission and retention policies of the SUCs provided that failure to comply with retention policies results in the student’s permanent disqualification from enrolling in any SUC or LUC; </p>

            <p> <strong>4.</strong> Students who fail to complete their bachelor’s degree or comparable undergraduate degree within a year after the period prescribed in the program.</p>
    </div>
        <h2>SOCIALIZED TUITION SYSTEM (STS)</h2>
        <div class="box">
        <p>Undergraduate students of the University of the Philippines (UP) receive financial support through the University’s Socialized Tuition System (STS). The STS grants tuition and other school fees (TOSF) subsidies and, in some cases, monthly stipends to students in need of financial support.</p>
        <p>The ST System was approved for implementation on 13 December 2013. The ST System is administered by the UP Office of Student Financial Assistance (OSFA), in partnership with the Student Affairs units in the different UP Constituent Universities (CUs). It is an essential tool to determine the form and amount of financial support to be granted to applicants. Student Affairs units also use the ST System to evaluate the support system of the student to determine other forms of student services that can help grantees in completing their degree requirements in UP.</p>
        <p>Under the STS, the type of support is based on a two-stage assessment of paying capacity of the household to which applicants belong. The first stage considers household income as well as the socio-economic characteristics of the household of students. Should the applicant feel that he/she needs more support, the student can submit an appeal in the second stage. In this stage, the student is encouraged to submit additional information about the present circumstances that would warrant additional financial assistance from UP. </p>
        <p>With the implementation of Republic Act No. 10931, all eligible undergraduate students are granted full TOSF subsidy while enrolled in UP. Although the Act addresses the issue of the affordability to enroll in the University, some students still face concerns about how to cover the daily cost of living while completing their degree program requirements. Student affairs personnel also recognize the value of a system to efficiently determine other forms of student services, which are provided by the ST System.</p>
    </div>
        <h2>Applicants who are not eligible for the TOSF subsidy under RA 10931 and have requested financial assistance.</h2>
        <div class="box">
